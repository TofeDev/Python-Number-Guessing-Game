Beginner CLI Project from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

I tried to made this months ago in Java (and I failed, for nobody's surprise), now I tried to do it in Python, which seems to be fine, but I know it's not the best.
It's my first CLI app, so it's probably terrible LMAO

I tried to make every feature that are said in the project, except for tracking the high score. Anyways I think I learned a lot from doing everything else.

This was fun to make.
